# DEVTOP 

Devtop is a plataform and puzzle game for PC, developed in Unity, with the intention of bringing the player closer to video games development. 

The game takes place at the desktop of Ashley, a young programmer who works for FlipFlop Games, an evil company that exploits its workers. In her spare time, she develops video games. The hero of our story is PixelMax -one of Ashley's characters-, whose game has been corrupted. He will have to travel through different software applications (Photoshop, C#, etc), solving the puzzles to fix his beloved world.

Devtop was originally conceived by six UFV students as an university work, and the first prototype was finished by May 17, 2019. Maybe the project will be continued...
